\section*{Acknowledgments}
The writer is indebted to his colleagues at the Laboratories, particularly
to Dr.~H.~W. Bode, Dr.~J.~R.~Pierce, Dr.~B.~McMillan, and
Dr.~B.~M.~Oliver for many helpful suggestions and criticisms during the
course of this work.  Credit should also be given to Professor N.~Wiener,
whose elegant solution of the problems of filtering and prediction of
stationary ensembles has considerably influenced the writer's thinking in
this field.
